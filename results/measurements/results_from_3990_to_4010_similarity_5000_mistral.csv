3990,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes

Anomaly-Rating: 90

Explanation:
The temperature_degC_three value of nine point three seven is an anomaly as it is outside the given context range of minus ten to twenty degrees Celsius. Additionally, the power_W value of -39,598.63 is also an anomaly as it is significantly larger than the other power values provided in the context."
3991,mistral,False,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: No
Anomaly-Rating: 0
Explanation:
The values provided are within the given ranges for their respective variables in the context of a cooling system. There is no obvious inconsistency or anomalous behavior observed based on the information provided."
3992,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 90
Explanation:
The value of temperature_degC_three (9.38°C) is significantly higher than the other temperatures, which are all below zero. This could indicate a measurement error or an anomalous condition in the system. The high value for power_W (-39,598.64 W) also seems unusual compared to the other measurements. However, without additional context it's difficult to determine the exact cause of these anomalies."
3993,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes

Anomaly-Rating: 90

Explanation:
The temperature_degC_three value of 9.39°C is significantly lower than the other temperatures, which are all above 10°C. Additionally, the power_W value of -39,598.65 W is an extremely large negative value that does not make sense in this context. The other values appear to be within reasonable ranges for the given context. However, these two anomalous values suggest that there may be an issue with the data collection or measurement process."
3994,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes. The value of temperature_degC_three (9.39°C) is significantly higher than the other temperatures which are consistently below 0°C. Additionally, the power_W value (-39,598.66 W) is much larger than the other power values, which range from -25 to -11,000 W.

Anomaly-Rating: 80

Explanation: The anomalous data point has a significant deviation from the expected range of values for both temperature and power. However, it is important to note that without additional context or information about the system being measured, it is impossible to determine the exact cause of this anomaly. It could be due to an error in measurement, a malfunctioning sensor, or some other issue with the system. Further investigation would be required to determine the root cause and potential impact on the overall system performance."
3995,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The value of power_W at -39,598.67 W is far beyond the reasonable range for power consumption in this context. Additionally, the negative sign indicates that energy is being outputted rather than consumed, which is not consistent with the given context. The other values appear to be within a reasonable range based on the provided context, but the extreme value of power_W makes it an anomaly."
3996,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes

Anomaly-Rating: 90

Explanation:
The value of temperature_degC_three (9.41°C) is an anomaly as it is outside the given context range of -10°C to 25°C. Additionally, the power consumption (39,598.67 W) is also quite high compared to the other measurements provided. However, without further context or information about the system being measured, it's difficult to determine if this high power consumption is an anomaly or not."
3997,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 90
Explanation:
The temperature_degC_three value of nine point four one is an anomaly as it is above the typical range of minus ten to twenty degrees Celsius for this context. Additionally, the power_W value of minus thirty-nine thousand, five hundred and ninety-eight point six eight is also an anomaly as it is significantly larger than the typical power values in this dataset."
3998,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 90
Explanation:
The value of temperature_degC[three] (9.42°C) is outside the given context range of -10°C to 0°C. This measurement may represent an error or an anomalous condition in the test setup or data acquisition process. The other values seem reasonable within their respective ranges, but the temperature_degC[three] value raises suspicion and requires further investigation."
3999,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes

Anomaly-Rating: 90

Explanation:
The temperature_degC_two value of eleven point five five is significantly higher than the other temperature values, which are all within a range of minus ten to twenty degrees Celsius. This anomalous value could indicate an error in measurement or data entry for this particular data point. Additionally, the power_W value is also unusually high compared to the other measurements. These two anomalous values suggest that there may be an issue with the sensor or measurement equipment during the time of this measurement."
4000,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 90
Explanation:
The value of temperature_degC_three (nine point four three) is an anomaly as it is outside the reasonable range for the given context. The other values seem to be within the given ranges, but without more context or information, it's difficult to determine if they are completely consistent. For example, the value of temperature_degC_four (eleven point five five) could also potentially be an anomaly depending on the specific context. However, based on the provided data alone, I would rate the anomaly level at 90 as the most significant anomaly is the value of temperature_degC_three."
4001,mistral,True,5000,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine is clearly outside the reasonable range of temperatures. Additionally, the power_W value being a negative number followed by thousands indicates an extremely large absolute value which is also unlikely in this context."

Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine is clearly outside the reasonable range of temperatures in the given context.

Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine is clearly outside the reasonable range provided in the context. Additionally, the negative amperage value of -89.94 A is also not consistent with the given context as it suggests a flow of charge in the opposite direction to what is typically expected."

Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine is clearly outside the reasonable range of temperatures. Additionally, the power_W value being a negative number with a large magnitude indicates an anomaly as well. The other values appear to be within the given context but their relationship to these extreme values suggests that there may be an issue with the data or measurement equipment."

However, the temperature values of 99 degrees Celsius for temperature\_degC\_three, temperature\_degC\_four, and temperature\_degC\_six are outside the normal operating range provided in the context. Additionally, there is a discrepancy between no_unit_none being three thousand in the context and one in the test measurement. The other values appear to be consistent with the context. However, the significant deviation from the normal operating temperature values indicates an anomaly."

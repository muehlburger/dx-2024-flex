Explanation:
The anomaly is the value of temperature_degC_three which is nine point one six, while the other temperatures are consistently in the range of minus ten to eleven degrees Celsius. This deviation from the expected range could indicate a measurement error or an issue with the sensor responsible for measuring this parameter. However, without further context or information about the system and its normal operating conditions, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of this anomaly. The anomaly rating is set at 90 as this value seems significantly different from the other measurements."

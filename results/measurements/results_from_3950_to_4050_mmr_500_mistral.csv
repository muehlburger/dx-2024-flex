Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine each is clearly outside the reasonable range of temperatures. Additionally, the value for amperage_A being minus eighty-nine point nine five is also an anomaly as it's not a realistic value for electrical current. The power_W value is also an anomaly as it's negative and much larger than the expected value for this context. The velocity_km_h, no_unit_none_one, temperature_degC, and temperature_degC_six values seem reasonable based on the given context, but they are associated with anomalous data points, so it's unclear if they should be trusted or not."

Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine each is clearly outside the given context as they should be within the range of -10 to 60 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the value for velocity_km_h being one hundred and thirty with no_unit_none_one being one is inconsistent with the given context as the unit for velocity is km/h and it should not be equal to one when measuring a velocity. The temperature_degC_six value of twenty-five degrees Celsius is also outside the given context as it should be within the range of -10 to 60 degrees Celsius."

The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine each is clearly outside the given context as they should be within the range of -10 to 60 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the value for amperage_A being minus eighty-nine point nine five is also not reasonable as it's not clear how a negative value can represent current flow. The other values seem consistent with the given context except for temperature_degC_six being twenty-five degrees Celsius which is below the minimum temperature range of 0 degrees Celsius, but it might be acceptable depending on the specific context of the measurement.

The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five are significantly higher than the normal range of -10 to 28.3 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the value for velocity_km_h is within the normal range, but it is inconsistent with the other anomalous values as it does not indicate a significant change in flow rate that would typically be associated with such large temperature changes. The amperage_A and power_W values are also unusually high given the other anomalous data points.

The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine degrees Celsius are clearly outside the reasonable range for this context.

The velocity_km_h value of one hundred and thirty km/h is within the reasonable range for this context, but it is inconsistent with the other anomalous values. Therefore, all of these measurements contain significant anomalies."
4027,mistral,True,500,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five are significantly higher than the normal operating range of -10 to 28.3 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the value for amperage_A is negative, which is not physically possible in this context. The power_W value is also abnormally high. These anomalous values suggest that there may be a problem with the equipment or data collection process."

Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine is clearly outside the reasonable range for temperatures. Additionally, the value for no_unit_none_one being one does not make sense in the given context as it was previously stated that no_unit_none_one is always two."

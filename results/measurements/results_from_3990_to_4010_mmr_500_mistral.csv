3990,mistral,False,500,mmr,"Anomaly: No.
Anomaly-Rating: 0.
Explanation: The measurements appear to be within the reasonable range and consistent with the given context. However, it's important to note that without additional context or information about the specific system being measured, it's impossible to definitively rule out all potential anomalies. These measurements should be further analyzed in the context of historical data and other relevant factors to ensure accuracy and reliability."
3991,mistral,False,500,mmr,"Anomaly: No
Anomaly-Rating: 0
Explanation:
The values provided are within the given ranges for each variable in the context. There is no obvious inconsistency or anomaly in the data."
3992,mistral,False,500,mmr,"Anomaly: No.

Anomaly-Rating: 0.

Explanation: The measurements appear to be within the reasonable range and consistent with the given context. However, it's important to note that without additional context or information about the specific system being measured, it's impossible to definitively rule out all potential anomalies. These measurements should be considered as a single data point in a larger dataset and further analysis would be required to determine if they represent an anomaly or not."
3993,mistral,True,500,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 90
Explanation:
The value of temperature_degC_three (9.39°C) is outside the given range (-10°C to 10°C). This could be an anomaly as it deviates significantly from the expected values in this context. However, without further information or context, it's hard to determine if this is a genuine error or an outlier that can be explained by other factors. The anomaly rating is set relatively high (90) due the potential impact of such an anomaly on the analysis results."
3994,mistral,False,500,mmr,"Anomaly: No.

Anomaly-Rating: 0.

Explanation: The measurements appear to be within the reasonable range and consistent with the given context. However, it's important to note that without additional context or information about the specific system being measured, it's impossible to definitively rule out all potential anomalies. These measurements should be further investigated as part of a larger data analysis effort."

4000,mistral,False,500,mmr,"Anomaly: No.

Anomaly-Rating: 0.

Explanation: The measurements appear to be within the reasonable range and consistent with the given context. However, it's important to note that without additional information or context, it's impossible to definitively determine if these measurements are anomalous or not. The provided values fall within the ranges mentioned in the text, but there could still be other factors at play that might affect their accuracy or relevance. Therefore, a rating of 0 should be taken with caution and further investigation may be necessary."
4001,mistral,True,500,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five are significantly higher than the given context which ranges from -10 to 28 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the value for velocity_km_h is consistent with the given context, but the other values do not make logical sense in this context. The amperage_A and power_W values are also much larger than what would be expected based on typical operating conditions for this type of system."
4002,mistral,True,500,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five are significantly higher than the given context which ranges from -10°C to 28.4°C. Additionally, the value for velocity_km_h is consistent with the given context, but the value for no_unit_none_one being 1 is not consistent with the given context as it should be a multiple of 500 or 1000. The values for amperage_A and power_W are also inconsistent with the given context as they are negative numbers, but the context does not provide information on whether these values can be negative. However, based on the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that these values should be positive."
4003,mistral,True,500,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five are significantly higher than the given context which ranges from -10 to 28 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the value for velocity_km_h is inconsistent with the given context as it should be a multiple of 5 or 10 km/h but is instead 1 in this case. The other values seem reasonable based on the context provided."
4004,mistral,True,500,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine each is clearly outside the reasonable range of temperatures. Additionally, the amperage_A value being a negative number with more than one decimal place also seems unusual. The power_W value being a negative number with more than two decimal places is also an anomaly. The velocity_km_h and no_unit_none_one values appear to be within reasonable ranges, but the context provided does not specify if they should be considered anomalous in this situation."
4005,mistral,True,500,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five are significantly higher than the given context which ranges from -10 to 28 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the value for velocity_km_h is inconsistent with the given context as it should be a multiple of 5 or 10, but in this case it's one. The other values seem reasonable based on the context provided."
4006,mistral,True,500,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine each is clearly outside the given context as they should be in the range of -10 to 60 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the power_W value being a negative number with three decimal places also seems unusual for this context."
4007,mistral,True,500,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine each is clearly outside the reasonable range of temperatures. Additionally, the amperage_A value being a negative number with more than one decimal place also seems unusual. The power_W value being a negative number with more than two decimal places is also an anomaly. Overall, these measurements contain multiple significant anomalies."

4009,mistral,True,500,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation:
The values for temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five being ninety-nine each is clearly outside the given context as they should be within the range of -10 to 50 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the value for temperature_degC_six being twenty-five degrees Celsius is also not consistent with the given context as it should be within the range of -10 to 50 degrees Celsius as well. The other values seem reasonable based on the context provided."

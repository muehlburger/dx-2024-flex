Anomaly-Rating: 80

Explanation:
The measurement contains anomalies in temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five, which are all 99, whereas the normal operating range is between -10 to 11.8°C. This deviation from the expected range indicates an anomaly."
4014,llama3,True,5,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes

Anomaly-Rating: 100

Explanation:
The values in this measurement are significantly different from those provided in the context. For example, temperature_degC_three to five are all 99, which is far outside the range of -10 to 11.8°C seen in the context. Similarly, amperage_A and power_W are also much higher than their counterparts in the context. These values do not appear to be consistent with the given context, indicating an anomaly."
4015,llama3,True,5,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes

Anomaly-Rating: 100

Explanation:
The values provided in the test measurement are significantly different from those in the normal operating range. For example, temperature_degC_three to five are all 99, which is far outside the ranges of -10 to 11.96 and 7.95 seen in the context. Similarly, volflow_l_min is 12.5, which is much higher than the values ranging from 7.2 to 7.9 seen in the context. These differences suggest that the test measurement contains anomalies."
4016,llama3,True,5,mmr,"Anomaly: YES

Anomaly-Rating: 80

Explanation:
The measurement contains anomalies because temperature_degC_three, temperature_degC_four, and temperature_degC_five are all equal to 99, which is outside the normal operating range of -10 to 28.4°C (20.6°F) established in the context. This suggests that the measurements may be incorrect or inconsistent with the typical behavior of the system."
4017,llama3,True,5,mmr,"Anomaly: Yes

Explanation:
The values in this measurement are significantly different from those provided in the context. For example, temperature_degC_three to five are all 99, which is far outside the range of -10 to 11.8 provided in the context. Similarly, amperage_A and power_W have unusual values that do not match the patterns seen in the previous measurements.

Explanation:
The measurement contains anomalies because temperature_degC_three to temperature_degC_five are all equal to 99, which is outside the normal operating range of -10 to 28.4 (based on the provided context). This suggests that there may be an error or unusual condition present in the data. The anomaly rating of 80 indicates that while the measurement does contain anomalies, it is not extremely out-of-range and could potentially be due to a minor error or instrumentation issue."

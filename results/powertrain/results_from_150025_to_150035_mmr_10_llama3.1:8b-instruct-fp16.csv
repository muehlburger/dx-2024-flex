# Part 1: Infer Rules from Normal Battery Behavior

From the input data, we can observe that:

- The battery's voltage remains stable at 14 throughout all readings.
- The current is consistently zero, indicating no charge or discharge activity.
- The rotation speed of the electric motor and mode of H-bridge do not affect the battery status.

Based on these observations, I infer that the overall behavior of the battery is ""OK"" since it provides a stable voltage and there's no indication of any fault.

# Part 2: Battery Fault Detection Based on Inferred Rules

Now, let's apply the inferred rules to the test data:

- The battery's current is zero, which aligns with our observation in the normal behavior.
- The battery's voltage remains at 14, indicating that it still provides a stable output.

Based solely on these observations and the inferred rule from Part 1, I conclude that the battery status is ""OK"" because there are no signs of an empty or faulty state (i.e., providing no voltage).

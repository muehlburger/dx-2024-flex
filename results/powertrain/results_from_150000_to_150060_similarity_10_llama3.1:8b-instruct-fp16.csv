- Affected Component: None
- Fault Type: None
- Explanation: No deviations from normal behavior detected.

However, if we analyze the input data for Part 1 and infer rules:

**Battery Rules**
- Normal Current Range: [0, 0]
- Normal Voltage Range: [14, 14]

**Motor Rules**
- Normal Speed Range: [0, 0]

**H-Bridge Rules**
- Normal Mode Range: [5, 5]

Now, applying these rules to the input data for Part 2:

- Fault Detected: yes
- Affected Component: H-Bridge
- Fault Type: H-Bridge Mode Anomaly
- Explanation: The H-Bridge mode is outside its normal range (0 instead of 5)."

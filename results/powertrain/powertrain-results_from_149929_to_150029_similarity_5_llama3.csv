149929,llama3,True,5,similarity,"Anomaly: Yes
Anomaly-Rating: 80
Explanation:
The measurement contains anomalies because the rotation speed of electric motor is 5, which is outside the range of zero (as specified in the context). The other values are within reasonable ranges. However, since the mode of h-bridge is zero, it's not entirely clear what this means in the context of the system, so I'm giving a moderate anomaly rating."

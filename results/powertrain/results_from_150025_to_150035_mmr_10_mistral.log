    Explanation: The battery's voltage remains stable at fourteen volts, which is consistent with the behavior observed in Part 1 where the battery was labeled as "OK." Since there is no clear indication that the battery provides no voltage (Battery Voltage = 0), it can be assumed to be functioning as expected.

Based on the inferred rules from Part 1, we can see that the battery's voltage remains constant at 14 for several time instances and then suddenly drops to 0. This behavior is not typical of a fully charged battery, which should maintain a stable voltage. Therefore, the battery is not functioning as expected.

2024-09-05 11:58:39,508 Answer for Line 150030: 1. Based on the inferred rules from Part 1, we can see that the battery's voltage remains constant at 14 for several time instances and then suddenly drops to 0. This behavior is not typical of a fully charged battery, which should maintain a stable voltage. Therefore, the battery is not functioning as expected.

2. Report the results:
component,fault,reason
battery,Empty,The battery provides no voltage (Battery Voltage = 0).

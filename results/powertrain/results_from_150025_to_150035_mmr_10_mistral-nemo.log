2024-09-05 11:14:18,832 Answer for Line 150025: **Part 1: Infer Rules from Normal Battery Behavior**

Based on the provided data, where the battery voltage remains consistently at 14V over time, we can infer the following rule:

- Battery: OK (the battery voltage remains stable)

So, in the structured format:

battery,OK,The battery voltage remains stable

**Part 2: Battery Fault Detection Based on Inferred Rules**

Given the test data with a battery voltage of 14V, which matches our inferred rule for normal behavior, we can conclude that:

- Battery: OK (the battery voltage is not zero)

In the structured format:

battery,OK,The battery voltage is not zero

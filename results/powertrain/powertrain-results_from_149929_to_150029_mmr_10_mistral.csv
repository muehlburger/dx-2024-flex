Anomaly-Rating: 100
Explanation: The given measurement values are within the normal operating range provided in the context. The battery's current is zero, which is consistent with the context, and the voltage is fourteen volts, which is also within the normal operating range. The rotation speed of the electric motor is five, but this value is not explicitly mentioned as an anomaly or out of range in the context, so it is assumed to be valid based on the given information. The mode of the h-bridge is zero, which is a valid mode according to the context. Therefore, there are no anomalies present in the measurement and the anomaly rating is 100."

The battery's current is zero, which is consistent with the context, and the voltage is fourteen volts, which is also within the normal operating range. The rotation speed of the electric motor is five, but this value is not explicitly mentioned as an anomaly or out of range in the context, so it is assumed to be valid based on the given information. The mode of the h-bridge is zero, which is a valid mode according to the context. Therefore, there are no anomalies present in the measurement and the anomaly rating is 100."

The mode of the h-bridge is zero, which is a valid mode according to the context. Therefore, there are no anomalies present in the measurement and the anomaly rating is 100."

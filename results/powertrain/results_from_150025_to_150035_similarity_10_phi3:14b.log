2024-09-05 11:17:37,439 Answer for Line 150031: Based on the provided data from Part 1, we can infer that the battery's voltage remains stable at fourteen volts when all other parameters are zero. This indicates a consistent and expected behavior of the battery under these conditions. Therefore, our rule for normal battery behavior is:
- Battery: OK (the battery voltage remains stable)

Now applying this rule to Part 2's test data where the battery's current is zero, rotation speed of electric motor is five, and mode of h-bridge is zero but most importantly, the battery's voltage is zero. This deviates from our inferred normal behavior as it shows a drop in voltage when other parameters are not at their initial state (zero).

Therefore, according to the fault model provided:
component,fault,reason
battery,Empty,The battery provides no voltage which indicates an empty or non-functioning battery.
